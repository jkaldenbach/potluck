# Problem

Lost lobster pots in the Bay of Fundy

* are a threat to wildlife (ghost fishing)
* damage the marine environment
* create economic loss for fishermen

GPS tracking has been proposed to solve this problem, but it is not feasible because

* GPS trackers cost more than new pots
* Trackers would need to be mounted above the water to work, becoming ineffective if the pot is detached from the buoy

# Solution

The provided solution provides a value-added smartphone applications for commercial fishermen to use when placing their pots. It facilitates uptake by integrating seamlessly into existing ways of working and providing enough value to the fishermen that use of the tool feels worth their while and less like paperwork. Pot location data can be saved and uploaded to a database once connectivity is regained, and regulating authorities can view lots pots with their last known location.

## Features

* ### Geolocate deployed pots

* ### Flag lost pots in the database

* ### Allow regulators to view lost pots for cleanup operations

* ### Predict probable locations of lost pots

* ### Display significant whether events

* ### Pot inventory management

## Future Development

* Provide hardware integration with existing GPS receivers to increase accuracy and seamlessly integrate with existing ways of working
* Link to laws and regulations based on geolocation 
* Tag catch quality at a location (stored privately)
